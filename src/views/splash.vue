          Had you heard of all the candidates for judge last time you voted? How
          about City Council at-Large? When you voted, a neighbor of yours
          likely handed you a ballot of candidates endorsed by your
          <span
            class="explanation"
            title="A roughly neighborhood-sized geographical division of the city"
            >ward</span
          >. If you haven’t heard of the candidates, why not take your
          neighbor’s advice?

          These endorsements are determined by Ward Leaders, and have a huge
          influence over who gets elected in Philadelphia. As powerful and few
          as they are (69), ward leaders tend to remain behind the scenes and
          most voters don’t even know who theirs is. This transparency web site
          aims to bring a level of spotlight to ward leaders that is more
          proportional to the power they wield.
