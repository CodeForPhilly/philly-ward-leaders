It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build\nsmall apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that\nsupport mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is\nnot a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves\nmuch of the application design, architecture and scalability to the\ndeveloper, including memory management, view management, and more.\n\nMarionette brings an application architecture to Backbone, along with\nbuilt in view management and memory management. It's designed to be a\nlightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone,\nproviding the framework for building a scalable application.\n\nLike Backbone itself, you're not required to use all of Marionette just\nbecause you want to use some of it. You can pick and choose which features\nyou want to use. This allows you to work with other Backbone\nframeworks and plugins easily. It also means that you are not required\nto engage in an all-or-nothing migration to begin using Marionette.\n\n### Chat with us\n\nFind us [on gitter](https://gitter.im/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) or on IRC in the FreeNode.net [#marionette channel](http://freenode.net).\n\nWe're happy to discuss design patterns and learn how you're using Marionette.\n\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n* Scalable: applications are built in modules, and with event-driven architecture\n* Sensible defaults: Underscore templates are used for view rendering\n* Easily modifiable: make it work with your application's specific needs\n* Reduce boilerplate for views, with specialized view types\n* Build on a modular architecture with an `Application` and modules that attach to it\n* Compose your application's visuals at runtime, with the `Region` and `LayoutView` objects\n* Nested views and layouts within visual regions\n* Built-in memory management and zombie-killing in views, regions and layoutViews\n* Event-driven architecture with `Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator`\n* Flexible, \"as-needed\" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need\n* And much, much more\n\n\n## Marionette Inspector\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/B1q9QXH.jpg\" align=\"center\" /></a>\n\n+ **Visualize** the view hierarchy with the UI tree\n+ **Visualize** application activity with a full history of actions\n+ **Inspect** view ui, events, listeners, properties\n+ **Inspect** model attributes, listeners, properties\n+ **Explore** Radio channel events, requests, commands\n+ **Explore** application with an inspector magnifying glass\n+ **Jump** between the inspector elements and source panel with intelligent links\n\nDownload at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marionette-inspector/fbgfjlockdhidoaempmjcddibjklhpka)  \nExplore code at  [Github](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette.inspector)\n\n## Source Code and Downloads\n\nYou can download the latest builds directly from the \"lib\" folder above.\nFor more information about the files in this folder, or to obtain an archive\ncontaining all Marionette dependencies (including Underscore, Backbone, etc.),\nplease visit [the downloads section on the website](http://marionettejs.com#download).\n\n#### [MarionetteJS.com](http://marionettejs.com#download)\n\n### Available Packages\n\nMarionette is available via bower, npm, and component.io. There are other channels that are maintained by the community.\n\n\n## Release Notes And Upgrade Guide\n\n**Changelog**: For change logs and release notes, see the\n[changelog](changelog.md) file.\n\n**Upgrade Guide**: Be sure to read [the upgrade guide](upgradeGuide.md)\nfor information on upgrading to the latest version of Marionette.\n\n\n### Annotated Source Code\n\nThe source code for Marionette is heavily documented.\nYou can read the annotations for all the details of how Marionette works, and advice on which methods to override.\n\n##### [View the annotated source code](http://marionettejs.com/annotated-src/backbone.marionette)\n\n## Compatibility and Requirements\n\nMarionetteJS currently works with the following libraries:\n\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) v1.8+\n* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) v1.4.4 - 1.6.0\n* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) v1.0.0 - 1.1.2 are preferred.\n* [Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr) Comes automatically with the bundled build.\n* [Backbone.BabySitter](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter) Comes automatically with the bundled build.\n\nMarionette has not been tested against any other versions of these\nlibraries. You may or may not have success if you use a version other\nthan what is listed here.\n\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Marionette's source code, please read\nthe [guidelines for pull requests and contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nFollowing these guidelines will help make your contributions easier to\nbring into the next release.\n\n### [Github Issues](//github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues)\n\nReport issues with Marionette, submit pull requests to fix problems, or to\ncreate summarized and documented feature requests (preferably with pull\nrequests that implement the feature).\n",
